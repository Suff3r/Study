A conditional variable is a mechanism that synchronizes with a shared global variable between threads, which consists of two actions: one thread waits for "conditional variables set up" and hangs; the other thread makes "conditions set up" (giving conditions to set up a signal). Conditional detection is carried out under the protection of mutex. If a condition is false, a thread automatically blocks and releases a mutex that waits for state changes. If another thread changes the condition, it signals the associated conditional variable, wakes one or more threads waiting for it, reobtains the mutex, and reevaluate the condition. If two processes share readable and written memory, conditional variables can be used to achieve thread synchronization between the two processes.
